## Research Interests
I am broadly interested in applied cryptography and its use in building systems that protect users’ privacy in the real world. Recently, I have become focused on proof systems and their potential to make machine learning more trustworthy and auditable. My research explores cryptographic approaches to trustworthy machine learning, including the design of zero-knowledge proofs for neural networks that enable verifiable inference without exposing sensitive model parameters. More broadly, I aim to develop privacy-preserving machine learning pipelines that not only safeguard users’ data but also provide auditable guarantees of compliance, combining secure multi-party computation and zero-knowledge proofs to create systems that can be transparently trusted in deployment.
