## Research Interests
 My research interests are in applied cryptography, with a particular focus on using the provable security methodology to build practical, privacy-preserving systems. I have experience in the design and analysis of cryptographic protocols, including zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation. I am also deeply interested in emerging challenges, such as the development of post-quantum cryptography to ensure long-term security for real-world applications and internet protocols.
